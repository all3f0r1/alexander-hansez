            Hello,<br />
            I'm Alexander, currently based in London United Kingdom after many years of traveling around the world.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            I can now finally call this old island my home.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            I enjoy capturing moments and make them as real as they are with little to no post editing.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            I love creating a story with every moments I capture.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            From a spontaneous moment during street photography to directing a portrait shoot or wedding. Whilst working, I choose my words carefully, always with an intention behind it.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            If I stay quiet, then that means I like what I see.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Directing isn't just about shouting all the time, its about finding the best within a situation/moment and bring it out for the camera to capture it.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            I believe my work reflects this.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            I love eating Belgian chocolate and I do this weird thing of waving at cats or dogs or any animals to be fair, to say hello.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Besides that and my bad dad jokes, I'm pretty normal person with a good eye and sense of story telling.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Some say it's not good to be Jack of all trades and one should focus on one specialisation.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            I disagree.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed font-medium">
            Jack of all trades master of none, not oftentimes better than master of one.
